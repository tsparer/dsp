# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Bash Scripting Tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/) or [Codecademy's Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line). These are helpful tutorials. You should be able to go through these in a couple of hours.

**Note:** Bash is not installed on a PC. Rather, PC users must install Cygwin. Once Cygwin has been installed, the command line interface witll _emulate_ bash. You can find all information regarding Cygwin [here](https://www.cygwin.com/).

### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

* pwd     = show current working directory or path
* ls      =  shows the files in the current directory
* ls -a   =  shows hidden files
* cd      = change directory
* mkdir   = creates a directory
* rmdir   = removes directory
* touch <filename> = creates a file
* rm      = removes file
* mv [options] <source> <destination>  = moves a file, can also be used to rename a file (by "moving it" to a new named space in the  same directory.
* cp <filename> <target_directory>  =  copy file : [here's nice list of commands and modifiers re: copy, remove, move etc.](https://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/move-copy-delete-files-linux/)
* sed – search and replace within a file
* sort [-options] [path] – sorts contents of a file, alphabetically by default
* chmod [permissions] [path] = change permissions  [Specific permissions settings here](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/permissions.php) .  Often need to use when a script isn't running.
 * man = manual, look up commands etc. 
 * ./  - not really a command, but remember to include ./  before running a program from the command line.
 * Reminder on the distinction between [absolute and relative paths](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/navigation.php)
